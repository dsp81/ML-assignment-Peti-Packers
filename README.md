#Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Assignment

Overview

This repository contains the solution files for the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) assignment. The tasks involve data preprocessing, model training using decision trees, and exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for activity classification. The repository includes Jupyter Notebooks with code implementations and analysis.

File Descriptions

task1final.ipynb
Contains the solution for Task 1, which focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the UCI-HAR dataset. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Task 3 DJ .ipynb
This notebook covers the solution for Task 3, where decision tree models are trained and evaluated using different feature sets. It also includes performance analysis of the models.

Task_4.ipynb
Implements Task 4, which involves the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot and few-shot learning in the context of activity recognition. It also compares LLM performance with traditional decision trees.

DecisionTrees/
This directory contains the implementation of a custom decision tree model from scratch. The files include code for training the custom model, evaluating its performance on classification tasks, and comparing it with scikit-learn's decision tree implementation.
